# assignmentCode
Commited the code for assignment.

for executing the code firstly go the the github repo link which is sended by me and then clone the code.
then do npm install in both backend and frontend through terminal.
then npm start in both  both backend and frontend terminal
you will see a payment page in the browser.

if you click on the Log in button then you will go to log in page
  where you can fill the details then click on submit.
  if the entries are correct then there will appears a "Go to payment page" button. 
  on clicking of that you will go to the payment page again but this time with a welcome message with your name.
  
  if any entry is in correct like name is less than 3 letters , password is less than 8, invalid email you will see which field is incorrect.
  
Now fill the details of shipping information then click on "proceed to payment" . 
i have added a test Razorpay payment method. 

the work of backend is only generate order_id and some stuffs for a razorpay test payment.
i have used backend because in the frontend there was some issue in the payment page.


Thanks
